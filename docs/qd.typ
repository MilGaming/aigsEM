Quality diversity algorithms, rather than finding a _single_ good solution to a
problem, constructs an archive of _different_ high performing solutions.
"Different" can be defined in various ways, an obvious—and only recently
possible—example being solutions that _look_ different to a vision model
@kumar2024. A popular#footnote[At least amongst the researches teaching you]
quality diversity algorithm is the pedagogically named "Multi-dimensional
Archive of Phenotypic Elites" (MAP-Elites) @mouret2015. Think of it as having a
fitness dimension, on which we maximize, and a set of behavioral dimensions we
want to cover/explore.

= Evolutionary algorithms

Today (September 16th, 2025) we will be playing with evolutionary algorithms, as
a way to get ready for quality diversity algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms are
at their core, extremely intuitive: randomly mutate, see what works, and then
further mutate on that. Inspired by the frequent bifurcation of species into two
sexes, we can further mix parts of one good solution with another, combining
them to get a new (perhaps even better solution). You will now:
1. Select a test function for optimization #footnote[#link(
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization",
  )]
2. Implement it in python (and visualize it)
3. Find its optimal solution using an evolutionary algorithm from the lecture
4. Make some cool plots of the results (get creative)

= PCGYM

Recall that Gym @towers2024 is a framework for reinforcement learning
environments, consisting of an `init` and a `step` method (the same as those in
our `aigs/games.py` file). Note further that (as the term suggests) procedural
content generation (PCG) focuses on the _procedure_ that generates a given piece
of content, rather than the content itself. To that effect we have made `pcgym`
#box[(itself derived from `pcgrl` @khalifa2020)] that enables quick ideation of
levels, supporting the kind of methods this lab is meant to have you play with.
You will now:
1. Explore `pcgym` #footnote[My fork of `gym-pcgrl` modified to work with our
    course. It is located at #link(
      "https://github.com/syrkis/pcgym",
    ) but is already included in our environment] and have a random agent play a
  level of any game.
2. Replace the random agent with a _randomly initialized_ agent, that maps game
  states to action.
3. Improve the randomly initialized agent using the basic evolutionary algorithm
  used in the previous task.
4. Bonus: think about whether the cross-over operator makes sense for your
  agent, and why / why not this is the case.

= A\*

A\* (A-star) is a pathfinding algorithm combining cost-so-far and estimated
cost-to-goal, balancing shortest-path (like Dijkstra) with goal-directed search
(like greedy best-first). In games like Mario, A\* is used to guide agents
efficiently through levels by evaluating possible moves via a cost function
(e.g., distance, obstacles) and a heuristic (e.g., estimated steps to the flag),
generating optimal or near-optimal action sequences toward the goal. You will
now:
1. Think a bit about A\* (what it is and how you would implement it)
2. Implement A\* or find an implementation online and have it play a level from
  `pcgym`


= Content generation

We can optimize levels, just like we can optimize players. Thinking about what
it means for a level to be "fit", you must now:
1. Define a fitness function for a level in `pcgym` (A\* can play a role in
  evaluating a level)
2. Define two _behavioral_ dimensions, meaning ways in which levels can be
  different, that are _not_ fitness related (e.g., number of jumps).
3. Generate an archive of good levels that are different from one another with
  (Timothée's beloved) MAP-Elite algorithm.
